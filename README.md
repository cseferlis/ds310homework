# DS 310 Data Mechanics

### Course Description
This course is focused on developing studentsâ€™ capacity to design and implement the data flows and the associated workflows that are meant to inform online and offline decision-making within large systems. To that end, in supervised group projects, students explore the data science lifecycle, including question formulation, data collection and cleaning (data wrangling), exploratory data analysis and visualization, and decision-making. The course applies tools and methods for data collection, retrieval, integration, and interpretation, using relational (SQL), non-relational (noSQL) and Big Data paradigms to assemble analysis, optimization, and decision-making algorithms to track and scale data. Topics covered include: consolidation, synchronization, and summarization of multiple data streams; data maintenance, and availability; optimization, and analytics that can operate on large amounts of static or streaming data; and online and offline interactive visualizations platforms for presenting and examining data. Projects and assignments in this course will leverage problems in real-world settings, especially those related to CDS Impact Labs and co-Labs focusing on equity, sustainability, health, and civic tech.


### Course Objectives
At the end of the course, successful students will have gained skills and hands-on experience on the following methods and technology: 

- Design and implementation of data processing pipelines 
- Complex data modeling 
- Architectural considerations for various data requirements 
- Relational query optimization 
- Dataflow programming abstractions 
- Data stream processing concepts 
- System support for distributed workloads 

Further, students will be exposed to recent developments in distributed data processing systems such as Hadoop, Apache Spark, Databricks and more through paper assignments and presentations. The collaborative semester-long project will prepare them for the practical aspects of their future careers and expose them to project management tools and software engineering best practices.
